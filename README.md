# Maternal-Health-Risk-Analysis
# Objective
This project is a beginner-level python project aimed to predict and understand health risks during pregnancy, emphasizing key indicators. By analyzing factors such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure levels and age, the project aims to provide valuable insights for improved maternal care.

# Dataset Description
This project utilized a healthcare dataset curated from Kaggle. The data originates from various hospitals, community clinics, and maternal health centers, collected through an IoT-based risk monitoring system. This system captures vital signs of pregnant women, allowing for early identification of potential health risks.

The following attributes were extracted from the dataset for model development:

**Age**: Age of the pregnant woman in years.

**SystolicBP**: Upper blood pressure reading in mmHg.

**DiastolicBP**: Lower blood pressure reading in mmHg.

**BS**: Blood glucose level in mmol/L (millimoles per liter).

**BodyTemp**: Body temperature in Fahrenheit.

**HeartRate**: Resting heart rate in beats per minute.

**Risk Level**: Predicted risk intensity level during pregnancy.

This comprehensive dataset provides valuable insights into the relationship between physiological parameters and potential pregnancy complications.

# Key Findings
* Elevated Risk Prevalence: A significant portion (over 25%) of the studied population exhibited a very high risk of complications during pregnancy.
* Blood Biomarker Significance: Blood glucose and blood pressure emerged as the most prominent indicators of potential health risks in pregnancy.
* Age and Risk Correlation: Women aged 35 and above demonstrated a higher propensity for pregnancy-related complications compared to younger age groups.
* Hypertension Prevalence: A substantial number of pregnant women in the dataset exhibited elevated blood pressure during pregnancy.
* Gestational Diabetes and Risk: Women with gestational diabetes were found to be at a greater risk of complications compared to others.
