# Maternal-Health-Risk-Analysis
# Description
This project is a beginner-level python project aimed to predict and understand health risks during pregnancy, emphasizing key indicators. By analyzing factors such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure levels and age, the project aims to provide valuable insights for improved maternal care.

# About the Dataset
This project utilized a healthcare dataset curated from Kaggle. The data originates from various hospitals, community clinics, and maternal health centers, collected through an IoT-based risk monitoring system. This system captures vital signs of pregnant women, allowing for early identification of potential health risks.

The following attributes were extracted from the dataset for model development:

/bold{Age:} Age of the pregnant woman in years.
SystolicBP: Upper blood pressure reading in mmHg.
DiastolicBP: Lower blood pressure reading in mmHg.
BS: Blood glucose level in mmol/L (millimoles per liter).
BodyTemp: Body temperature in Fahrenheit.
HeartRate: Resting heart rate in beats per minute.
Risk Level: Predicted risk intensity level during pregnancy.
This comprehensive dataset provides valuable insights into the relationship between physiological parameters and potential pregnancy complications.
